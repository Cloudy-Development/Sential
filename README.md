# Sential - Basic Essentials plugin

Sential is basic light-weight essentials plugin for minecraft servers. 

This is an alternative choice for smaller servers that don't need or look for features a server core would provide.
It's quite useful in Test servers for developers who want to test their plugins too.

Also, this plugin does not require any kind of databases, it all works through config files. It's made like that on purpose, to make things easier.

###### *Forking, modifying, and using this plugin is allowed as long as you follow the license terms.*
